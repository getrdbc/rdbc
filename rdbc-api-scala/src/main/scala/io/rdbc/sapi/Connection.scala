/** Represents a database connection (session).
  *
  * Instances of implementations of this trait can be obtained using a [[ConnectionFactory]]. When clients are done
  * with the connection, they are required to call a `release` method co clean up resources such as open sockets.
  *
  * Invoking any method of this trait when any previous operation has not completed yet is not allowed. Operation is
  * considered complete when a resulting [[scala.concurrent.Future Future]] completes.
  *
  * Transaction management has to be done using `beginTx`, `commitTx` and `rollbackTx` methods. Using SQL statements to
  * manage transaction state is not allowed.
  *
  * SQL statements passed as this class method arguments can be parametrized using a following syntax:
  * Parameters are named. Parameter is comprised of an alphanumeric name prefixed with a colon. One parameter can
  * occur multiple times in one statement. Examples of valid statements are listed below:
  *  - `select * from users where login = :login`
  *  - `select * from users where login = :query or given_name = :query`
  *
  * @define timeoutInfo
  *  After the operation takes longer time than `timeout`, operation will be aborted. Note however, that it may not
  *  be feasible to abort the operation immediately.
  * @define statementExceptions
  *  Returned future can fail with:
  *  - [[io.rdbc.api.exceptions.SyntaxErrorException SyntaxErrorException]] - when statement is not syntactically correct
  *  - [[io.rdbc.api.exceptions.UncategorizedRdbcException UncategorizedRdbcException]] - when general error occurs
  * @define timeoutException
  *  - [[io.rdbc.api.exceptions.TimeoutException TimeoutException]] - when maximum operation time has been exceeded
  * @define statementParametrization
  *  For syntax of statement parametrization see a [[Connection]] documentation.
  * @define returningInsert
  *  Returns a [[ReturningInsert]] instance bound to this connection that represents a SQL insert statement that
  *  can return keys generated by the database engine.
  *
  *  It is not defined whether the method returns exceptionally if SQL provided is a valid statement,
  *  but not an insert statement.
